SVG wallpapers for your laptop and desktop

Use the optimized wallpaper on your desktop. It doesn't depend on fonts and the glyphs have been turned to paths. Use the original file for editing:
running-ubuntu-red-bg.svg **USE FOR EDITING**
running-ubuntu-red-bg-optimized.svg **USE AS YOUR DESKTOP BACKGROUND**

I used [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org/).
